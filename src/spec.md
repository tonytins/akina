Akina derives it's phonology from Japanese, specifically Old Japanese. It has four vowels and nine constants. For the most part, the constants are the same as English but they're never used independently and are instead combined with vowels to form [moras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics)#Japanese); a distant concept from that of syllables. Each mora occupies one rhythmic unit, i.e. it is perceived to have the same time value. A mora consists of a vowel (V) and constant and a vowel (CV).

| Type | IPA  | Akina      | Moras per-word |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- | -------------- |
| V    | /i/  | e 'tail'   | 1-mora word    |
| CV   | /ta/ | ta 'world' | 2-mora word    |

## Word order

Akina has a SVO (Subject + Verb + Object) with a secondary SOV (Subject + Object + Verb) word words, similar to German.

| Orders               | Full name               | Secondary |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| SOV                  | Subject + Object + Verb |           |
| SVO                  | Subject + Verb + Object | Yes       |
| T+/ja/-V-(AUX)-F-AUX | Free word order         | Yes       |

Akina's **defualt** word order has modifers and verbs that follow most SOV conventions.

| Before             | After            |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Noun               | Adjective        |
| Noun               | Relative Clause  |
| Noun               | Demonstrative    |
| Noun               | Definite Article |
| Indefinite Article | Noun             |
| Genitive           | Noun             |
| Adjective          | Adverb           |
| Main Verb          | Negates Aux.     |
| Main Verb          | Modal            |
| Negates            | Future Aux.      |
| Question Aux.      | Future Aux.      |

This is only the default as word order but it's by no means mandatory. As the above it shows, SVO or free word order applies too. In free word order, T+/ja/-V-(AUX)-F-AUX means Topic + "ya" + Verb - (Auxiliary) - Focus - Auxiliary.

- "ya" serves as the topic marker.
- "n" is added as a suffix on the noun in free word order.
