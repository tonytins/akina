## Word order

Akina has a SVO (Subject + Verb + Object) with a secondary SOV (Subject + Object + Verb) word words, similar to German.

| Orders               | Full name               | Secondary |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| SOV                  | Subject + Object + Verb |           |
| SVO                  | Subject + Verb + Object | Yes       |
| T+/ja/-V-(AUX)-F-AUX | Free word order         | Yes       |

Akina's *default* word order has modifiers and verbs that follow most SOV conventions.

| Before             | After            |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Noun               | Adjective        |
| Noun               | Relative Clause  |
| Noun               | Demonstrative    |
| Noun               | Definite Article |
| Indefinite Article | Noun             |
| Genitive           | Noun             |
| Adjective          | Adverb           |
| Main Verb          | Negates Aux.     |
| Main Verb          | Modal            |
| Negates            | Future Aux.      |
| Question Aux.      | Future Aux.      |

This is by no means mandatory. As the above it shows, SVO or free word order applies too. In free word order, T+/ja/-V-(AUX)-F-AUX means Topic + "ya" + Verb - (Auxiliary) - Focus - Auxiliary.

- "ya" serves as the topic marker.
- "n" is added as a suffix on the noun in free word order.
